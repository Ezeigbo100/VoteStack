===========================

A robust smart contract implementation for secure and transparent voting on the Stacks blockchain.

Overview
--------

This smart contract provides a decentralized solution for conducting transparent, secure, and tamper-resistant elections on the Stacks blockchain. The system supports multiple election types with customizable parameters, candidate registration, voter verification, weighted voting, and vote delegation.

Features
--------

-   **Multiple Election Management**: Create and manage multiple elections simultaneously
-   **Configurable Voting Parameters**: Customize registration periods, voting periods, and election descriptions
-   **Candidate Registration**: Register candidates with detailed manifestos
-   **Secure Voter Registration**: Register voters with customizable voting weights
-   **Zero-Knowledge Identity Verification**: Protect voter privacy while ensuring legitimate participation
-   **Delegated Voting**: Allow voters to delegate their voting power to trusted representatives
-   **Transparent Vote Counting**: All votes are publicly verifiable while maintaining voter privacy
-   **Time-Bound Elections**: Elections have defined start and end blocks to control voting periods

Retrieves details of a specific election.

```
(get-election (election-id uint))

```

Parameters:

-   `election-id`: The ID of the election

Returns:

-   Election details or `none` if not found

#### `get-candidate`

Retrieves details of a specific candidate.

```
(get-candidate (election-id uint) (candidate-id uint))

```

Parameters:

Data Structures
---------------

### Elections

```
(define-map elections
    { election-id: uint }
    {
        name: (string-ascii 128),
        description: (string-utf8 512),
        start-block: uint,
        end-block: uint,
        registration-end-block: uint,
        admin: principal,
        status: (string-ascii 20),
        candidates-count: uint,
        voters-count: uint
    }
)

```

### Candidates

```
(define-map candidates
    { election-id: uint, candidate-id: uint }
    {
        name: (string-utf8 128),
        manifesto: (string-utf8 512),
        vote-count: uint
    }
)

```

### Voters

```
(define-map voters
    { election-id: uint, voter: principal }
    {
        registered: bool,
        voted: bool,
        weight: uint,
        vote-timestamp: (optional uint)
    }
)

```

### Verified Identities

```
(define-map verified-identities
    { voter: principal }
    {
        verified: bool,
        verification-method: (string-ascii 50),
        verification-timestamp: uint
    }
)

```

Security Considerations
-----------------------

This smart contract implements several security measures:

1.  **Access Controls**: Only election administrators can add candidates
2.  **Time-Bound Operations**: All critical operations are time-bound to specific blocks
3.  **State Validation**: Each operation validates the current state before proceeding
4.  **Identity Verification**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure voter legitimacy while preserving privacy
5.  **Vote Privacy**: The contract records voting without linking specific votes to voters

Implementation Guidelines
-------------------------

### Setting Up an Election

1.  Call `create-election` with appropriate parameters
2.  Add candidates using `add-candidate`
3.  Open registration for voters
4.  When registration period ends, voting begins
5.  When voting period ends, results are automatically finalized

### Identity Verification Integration

The contract includes a framework for zero-knowledge identity verification. To implement a complete solution:

1.  Develop an off-chain identity verification system
2.  Generate zero-knowledge proofs of identity
3.  Submit proofs to the `verify-voter-identity` function
4.  Only verified identities should be allowed to register as voters

### Delegation System

The delegation system allows voters to:

1.  Delegate their voting power before voting begins
2.  Increase the voting weight of trusted representatives
3.  Create a more efficient voting mechanism for large communities

Use Cases
---------

-   **Governance Voting**: DAOs and decentralized protocols
-   **Community Decisions**: Neighborhood and community voting
-   **Corporate Governance**: Shareholder voting with weighted representation
-   **Public Elections**: Small-scale transparent public elections
-   **Token-Holder Decisions**: Votes for token holders in DeFi protocols
